# Shortest-Uncommon-Subsequence
Given two strings S and T, find length of the shortest subsequence in S which is not a subsequence in T. If no such subsequence is possible, return -1. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. A string of length n has  2^n different possible subsequences.  String S of length m (1 &lt;= m &lt;= 1000) String T of length n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 1000)  Examples:  Input : S = “babab” T = “babba” Output : 3 The subsequence “aab” of length 3 is  present in S but not in T.  Input :  S = “abb” T = “abab” Output : -1 There is no subsequence that is present  in S but not in T.
